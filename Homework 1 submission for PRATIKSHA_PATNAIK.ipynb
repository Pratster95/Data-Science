From the above scatter plot we can see that the majority of tax payees are Police Officers and they were hired in bulk every year. Different colours show us the various Job Titles that are available in the Police Department. Different departments pay different taxes. Office Support Specialist- the one in yellow colour dots in the plot, have the least salary and hence they pay a small amount of tax."
